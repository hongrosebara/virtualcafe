### Instructions

#### Step 1.

Start by brewing the Vietnamese coffee. Place the coffee grounds in a Vietnamese coffee filter (also known as a phin) and set it on top of a cup or glass.

#### Step 2.

Slowly pour hot water into the coffee filter, filling it to the top. Allow the coffee to drip through the filter and into the cup. This process may take a few minutes.

#### Step 3.

While the coffee is brewing, prepare a separate glass with ice cubes.

#### Step 4.

Once the coffee has finished dripping, stir in the sweetened condensed milk until well combined.

#### Step 5.

Pour the coffee mixture over the ice cubes in the glass, allowing the ice to cool the coffee and create a refreshing iced beverage.

#### Step 6.

Stir the coffee and condensed milk mixture with the ice cubes, ensuring that it is well chilled.

#### Step 7.
Serve immediately and enjoy the delightful Vietnamese Café Sua Da!

Note: Adjust the amount of coffee and sweetened condensed milk according to your taste preferences. Some variations include adding additional sugar or using evaporated milk instead of condensed milk. Feel free to customize the recipe to suit your liking.
