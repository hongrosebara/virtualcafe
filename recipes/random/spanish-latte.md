Once you have the ingredients, you are ready to start making your coffee. It basically comes in two parts that are mixed together at the end.

### Instructions

#### Step 1

Spanish Latte’s are based around an espresso so you will need to make yourself a good one to start with. This doesn’t require a full espresso machine, as you can use a lower cost stove-top version.

#### Step 2

Slowly pour hot water into the coffee filter, filling it to the top. Allow the coffee to drip through the filter and into the cup. This process may take a few minutes.

#### Step 3

While the coffee is brewing, prepare a separate glass with ice cubes.

#### Step 4

Once the coffee has finished dripping, stir in the sweetened condensed milk until well combined.

#### Step 5

Pour the coffee mixture over the ice cubes in the glass, allowing the ice to cool the coffee and create a refreshing iced beverage.

#### Step 6

Stir the coffee and condensed milk mixture with the ice cubes, ensuring that it is well chilled.

#### Step 6
Serve immediately and enjoy the delightful Vietnamese Café Sua Da!

Note: Adjust the amount of coffee and sweetened condensed milk according to your taste preferences. Some variations include adding additional sugar or using evaporated milk instead of condensed milk. Feel free to customize the recipe to suit your liking.


## What is a Spanish Latte?

A Spanish latte, or Café con Leche, is a white coffee that originated in Spain and is made by combining a strong coffee, usually in the form of espresso, with hot milk. Some variations use condensed milk and, as well as in Spain, the drink is popular across Latin America, the Philippines, and the Cuban parts of Florida where they serve it for breakfast.

People from these countries often reminisce about having a Café con Leche every morning when they woke up, and the drink has a special place in their minds and culture.
