excerpt: 'Java Press’ slogan is “Coffee so good, we beat our beans on it.” It’s not just a cute slogan. Their fresh roasted coffee beans are delivered within two hours of roasting! Talk about super fresh. Plus, they keep it real by highlighting an international coffee from a small family owned coffee farm.'
